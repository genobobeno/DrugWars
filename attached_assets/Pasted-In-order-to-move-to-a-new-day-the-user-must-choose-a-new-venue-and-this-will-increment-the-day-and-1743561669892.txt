In order to move to a new day, the user must choose a new venue, and this will increment the day and load a new drug market. The market is different in each location on each day and the exact market prices and market inventory will change. Each drug will have a probability for being on the market each day (market_daily_probability). The following JSON schema is going to describe the random number generator parameters for each drug price, assuming there is no event, and the random number generators will always assume a uniform random number distribution of two parameters: a lower and upper limit, listed in the JSON as "no_event_parameters". There will also be a probability that an anomalous event will happen (daily_event_probability) that will either raise or lower the price of the drug according to a second set of uniform distribution parameters (event_parameters). When this anomalous event happens, a dialog box needs to show at the onset of the new day.
