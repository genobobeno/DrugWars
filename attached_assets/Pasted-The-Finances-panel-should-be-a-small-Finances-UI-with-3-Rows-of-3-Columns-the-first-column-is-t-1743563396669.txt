The "Finances" panel should be a small "Finances" UI with 3 Rows of 3 Columns; the first column is the row label, the second column are numbers taken directly from the scoreboard, and the third column are action buttons. In the first row, the first column will have a fixed label of "Cash", the second column will be the `Cash` amount in the scoreboard, and the third column will be a button labeled "Deposit". In the second row, the first column will be the row label "Bank", the second column will be the number of dollars in the Bank as reflected on the scoreboard, and the third column will be labeled "Withdraw". In the third row, the first column will be the label "Debt", the second column will be showing the Debt amount as reflected in the scoreboard, and the third column will be the action button "Pay Loan". If the number in the "Cash" row is any bigger than zero, a click of the "Deposit" action button will generate a dialog box that asks the user "How much?" along with an adjustable number that they can add to the `Bank` amount, between zero and the maximum total amount in `Cash`. The dialog will default to the total number in `Cash` and the user can adjust that number down. On the right of the dialog box will be the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, and upon clicking "OK" will subtract that number from the `Cash` amount and add the same number to the `Bank` amount, and this will immediately be updated on the Scoreboard. If the `Cash` amount is zero, the "Deposit" button will be disabled. If the number in the "Bank" row is any bigger than zero, the "Withdraw" button will generate a dialog box asking "How much?" along with an adjustable number showing the `Bank` amount that can be added to the `Cash` and subtracted from the `Bank`. The number can be adjusted between zero and the total amount in `Bank`. On the right of the dialog box will be the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, and upon clicking "OK" will subtract the chosen number from the `Bank` amount and add the same number to the `Cash` amount, and this will immediately be updated on the Scoreboard. If the `Bank` amount is zero, the "Withdraw" button will be disabled. When clicking the "Pay Loan" button, a dialog box will open asking "How much?" along with a default downwardly adjustable number that is the minimum of the `Cash` amount and `Debt` currently reflected on the Scoreboard. On the right of the dialog box will be the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, and upon clicking "OK" the game will subtract the chosen number from the `Cash` amount and subtract the same number from the `Debt` amount, and this will immediately be updated on the Scoreboard. If the `Debt` number is zero, the "Pay Loan" button will be disabled.
